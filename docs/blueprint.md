# **App Name**: LegalEagle

## Core Features:

- Legalese Distiller: Use an AI tool to extract legal clauses from the provided URL, such as service terms or privacy policy, identifying key points, obligations, and rights.
- Clause Visualization: Display the extracted legal clauses in a summarized, easy-to-understand format. Use distinct styling for obligations and rights.
- URL Input: Allow users to input a URL and initiate the legalese distillation process. The application prefills the url `https://9000-firebase-legalese-distiller2-1756125687827.cluster-y3k7ko3fang56qzieg3trwgyfg.cloudworkstations.dev`.
- Error Handling: Implement basic error handling to gracefully manage invalid URLs or parsing failures.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#79A3B1) evoking trust and clarity, to enhance the feeling of reliability associated with legal documents.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F4F5) for a clean, readable layout.
- Accent color: Muted orange (#D98E6B) to highlight important clauses and actions.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for readability and a modern, neutral look.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent different types of legal clauses or user actions.
- Maintain a clean and structured layout, separating the input area, distillation results, and extracted clauses clearly.
- Use subtle animations to indicate the loading state during the distillation process.
